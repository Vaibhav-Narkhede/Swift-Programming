## iOS Architecture

iOS architecture is the design and structure of the iOS operating system, which is the software platform that runs on Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. iOS architecture is layered, which means it consists of several levels of abstraction that provide different services and functionalities to the applications and the hardware.

The iOS architecture can be divided into four main layers:

- Core OS layer: This is the lowest level layer that provides the basic services and features that most other technologies rely on. It includes frameworks such as Core Bluetooth, Accelerate, External Accessory, Security Services, Local Authentication, etc. It also supports 64-bit app development and execution.
- Core Services layer: This layer provides essential system services and interfaces for apps, such as data management, networking, file access, iCloud integration, social media integration, etc. It includes frameworks such as Address Book, CloudKit, Core Data, Core Foundation, Core Location, Core Motion, Foundation, HealthKit, HomeKit, Social, StoreKit, etc.
- Media layer: This layer provides advanced graphics, audio, video, and animation technologies for apps. It includes frameworks such as AVFoundation, Core Audio, Core Graphics, Core Image, Core Text, Core Video, Image I/O, Metal, OpenGL ES, Quartz Core, SceneKit, SpriteKit, etc.
- Cocoa Touch layer: This is the highest level layer that provides the user interface and user interaction features for apps. It includes frameworks such as UIKit, MapKit, MessageUI, NotificationCenter, PhotosUI, PushKit, SafariServices, WatchKit, etc.

The iOS architecture allows apps to communicate with the hardware through a set of well-defined system interfaces that are provided by the frameworks in each layer. Apps do not access the hardware directly. The lower layers provide more basic and fundamental services to the apps and the higher layers provide more sophisticated and specialized services. The iOS architecture also allows developers to use different programming languages and tools to create apps for iOS devices.
