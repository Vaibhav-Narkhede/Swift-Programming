# Design Patterns implemented in Swift 5.0


Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems

 ## Types of Design Patterns
* Creational -> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

* Structural -> Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. Or yet another explanation would be, they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

* Behavioral -> It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering "How to run a behavior in software component?"
